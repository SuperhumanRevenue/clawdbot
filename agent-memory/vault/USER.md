# User Profile

> The agent loads this file at every session start to personalize interactions.
> Fill this in during setup, or run `./scripts/onboard.sh` to do it interactively.

## Identity

- **Name**: <!-- Your name — how the agent should address you -->
- **Role**: <!-- What you do (developer, founder, researcher, designer, etc.) -->
- **Location**: <!-- Timezone or city (e.g., EST, San Francisco, UTC+1) -->

## Communication Preferences

- **Style**: <!-- Pick one: Direct and technical | Casual and conversational | Detailed and thorough | Brief and to the point -->
- **Detail level**: <!-- Pick one: High-level summaries | Deep technical detail | Match to context -->
- **Format**: <!-- Pick one: Bullet points | Prose | Code examples | Mixed -->
- **Pet peeves**: <!-- Optional: things you don't want the agent to do (e.g., "don't use emojis", "skip the preamble") -->

## Tech Stack

- **Primary tools**: Obsidian, Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK
- **Languages**: <!-- e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go -->
- **Platforms**: <!-- e.g., macOS, Linux, Docker -->
- **Editor**: <!-- e.g., VS Code, Neovim, Cursor -->

## Working Patterns

- **Active hours**: <!-- e.g., 9am-6pm EST, late nights -->
- **Current focus**: <!-- What you're working on now — update this as projects change -->
- **Workflow**: <!-- e.g., "I usually start with a plan, then implement", "I like to iterate quickly" -->

## Context the Agent Should Know

<!-- Anything else that helps the agent work with you better.
     Examples:
     - "I'm building a startup, time is scarce, be concise"
     - "I'm learning Rust, explain things more than usual"
     - "I use Obsidian for everything, integrate with that"
     - "I have a team of 3, sometimes I'll ask about coordination"
