# Alternative Briefing Formats

Use these when the user requests a specific format or when the default doesn't fit the context.

## Executive Summary Format

For stakeholders or when brevity is critical:

```markdown
## Executive Summary — {date}

**Status**: {one sentence on overall project health}
**Blockers**: {count} items need attention
**Velocity**: {N} decisions made, {N} items completed this week

**Priority items:**
1. {most urgent item}
2. {second priority}
3. {third priority}
```

## Sprint-Style Format

For agile teams tracking work in sprints:

```markdown
## Sprint Update — {sprint name/number}

**Done** (since last standup):
- {completed item}

**In Progress**:
- {active item} — {status/blocker}

**Up Next**:
- {planned item}

**Blockers**:
- {blocker} — needs {who/what} to unblock
```

## Changelog Format

For tracking what changed, good for development-heavy periods:

```markdown
## Changelog — {date}

### Added
- {new decision, feature, or capability}

### Changed
- {updated approach, revised plan}

### Decided
- {decision title}: {choice} (rationale: {why})

### Open
- {unresolved question or pending decision}
```

## Minimal Format

For quick checks or low-activity periods:

```markdown
**{date}**: {N} decisions, {N} open threads, {N} follow-ups. Top priority: {item}.
```
